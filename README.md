# Linux Hands-on Practice

This repository documents my **practical Linux learning** through hands-on exercises, scripts, and configuration experiments.

The focus is on **understanding system behavior**, not just memorizing commands.

##  Purpose

- Practice system administration tasks
- Develop confidence with the command line
- Create a solid base for cloud, DevOps, and security roles

- Short, focused practice logs
- Bash scripts for common tasks
- Configuration experiments
- Mistakes encountered and how they were fixed
