## 2025-01-29 — File Permissions and Ownership

What I did:
- Practiced file permissions using chmod
- Used numeric permission values (644, 755)
- Changed file ownership using chown
- Changed group ownership using chgrp

Commands used:
- chmod
- chown
- chgrp
- ls -l

What confused me:
- Difference between file permissions and directory permissions

What I learned:
- Numeric permissions control read, write, execute
- Ownership affects who can access or modify files

Status:
- Basics understood, need more practice
